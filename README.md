Spacetime-Optimization-of-Articulated-Character-Motion
======================================================

I am currently working with Dr. Stephen Lane at the University of Pennsylvania to implement a project focusing on spacetime optimization of character motion. Given a set of user defined input constraints, the goal of this project is minimize a predefined energy function and determine the optimal set of torques and orientations on each body joint that achieves the constrained goals over a finite framerange. This research will tie in directly to Nvidia's physX engine and eventually migrate to the GPU.
